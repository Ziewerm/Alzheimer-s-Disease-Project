# Alzheimers-Disease-Project
Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of dementia. The core focus in researching AD is through the Tau-Amyloid Mechanism. 
This project aims to use machine learning to find important biomarkers for AD.
This project aims to focus on Random Forest to systematically test different sampling techniques that can be used to address unbalanced datasets.
Furthermore, this project uses hyperparameter tuning to test different numbers of trees and mtries
This project also builds a PubMed pipeline to visualise how often the biomarkers identified through this project appear in literature and what the current research focus is.
The three Scripts are the Data Pre Processing Pipeline, the ML Pipeline, and the PubMed Pipeline. The Data Preprocessing pipeline ensures that the data is clean, so that the ML pipeline will not encounter any problems. The ML pipeline is where all the machine learning takes place and the PubMed pipeline is where the systematic pubmed search happens.
